I don’t know how to start, but I didn’t have the intent to write my farewell, since a lot of people I follow published their farewell, I decided to write one to encourage me to do better things next year.

### Personal life:
- Engaged at 16th Feb.
- Graduated.
- Married at 17th August.
- Moved to Berlin, Germany.

### Work:
I didn't have a plan to achieve for 2018, so things happened  in a random way.

- Started my own blog.
- Created my first golang library **Rate Limit** ([here](https://github.com/ahmedash95/ratelimit)).
- Joind [@GetYourGuide](https://twitter.com/getyourguide)
- Created an **Golang Alexa SDK** ([here](https://github.com/ahmedash95/go-alexa-sdk)).

### Next year goals:

- Read 3 Tech books
- Read 3 Novels /Non-tech books
- Attend tech conferences in Europe ( specially Laracon )
- Starting my sass project

I think that's all for 2019, I'm excited to see what will happen in 2019.
